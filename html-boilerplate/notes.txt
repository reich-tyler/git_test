index.html (and <head> basics)
        - The file that contains the homeplage should ALWAYS be called index.html
        - <head> is where you store important meta information, it is meant to give information to help ensure
          the page renders correctly
            * Should NOT put any element that displays content on the page
            * <title> does not display ON the page, however it is displayed on the browser tab
        - <body> is where all the information that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.
            * will ALWAYS go below the <head> element 
        - typing <! and then tab will auto format a boilerplate
